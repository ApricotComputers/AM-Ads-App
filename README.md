# AM-Ads-App
Showing ads... yes, I know, most people hate seeing Ads anywhere. But, we are doing it to do so that's not so "used-car-salesman" like. But we will show more ads to support our overhead, while making the ad content relevant. Similar to how your friend will say "Hey, Bill, you up for drinks at O'connors Pub?" See, I advertised without advertising.

WiFi-based Advertising System for AirtelAds.
Implementation Steps: 

Overview: 
This system will display advertisements to users who have agreed to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the free WiFi service. When someone connects to free WiFi, we can off-set the ISP costs by showing ads on their phone. For now only Android phones can connect to the service.. later we will allow other devices to connect such as PC's and other devices. But for now only Android phones can connect. Ads will be shown during the WiFi login process and while users are connected to the network.

This app has an ad inventory management system
AM Ads also has an ad serving algorithm optimized for WiFi users

A robust consent tracking mechanism
Easy-to-use opt-out functionality

Mobile App Development (Optional):
