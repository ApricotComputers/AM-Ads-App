# AM-Ads-App
Showing ads... yes, I know, most people hate seeing Ads anywhere. But, we are doing it to do so that's not so "used-car-salesman" like. But we will show more ads to support our overhead, while making the ad content relevant. Similar to how your friend will say "Hey, Bill, you up for drinks at O'connors Pub?" See, I advertised without advertising.

WiFi-based Advertising System for AirtelAds.
Implementation Steps: 

Overview: 
This system will display advertisements to users who have agreed to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the free WiFi service. When someone connects to free WiFi, we can off-set the ISP costs by showing ads on their phone. For now only Android phones can connect to the service.. later we will allow other devices to connect such as PC's and other devices. But for now only Android phones can connect. Ads will be shown during the WiFi login process and while users are connected to the network.

Ad Management System: 
Create an ad inventory management system
Develop an ad serving algorithm optimized for WiFi users

User Consent System: 
Implement a robust consent tracking mechanism
Develop easy-to-use opt-out functionality

Mobile App Development (Optional): 
This is really about the Design and development of a companion mobile app
Implement push notification system

Testing and Optimization: 
Conduct thorough testing of the entire WiFi advertising flow
Optimize ad display and targeting based on initial performance data

Deployment and Monitoring: 
Roll out the system to selected WiFi hotspots
Establish monitoring procedures for system performance and user feedback

User Flow: 
User connects to the free WiFi network
Captive portal appears, presenting terms and conditions
User accepts terms and conditions

Periodic ads are displayed in designated areas (e.g., notification bar) while connected
User can opt-out at any time through the portal or companion app

Ethical Considerations: 
Clear and concise terms and conditions
Transparent data usage policies
Easy-to-find and use opt-out mechanisms
Respecting user privacy and data protection regulations

Benefits: 
Cost-effective advertising channel
Highly targeted ads based on location and context
